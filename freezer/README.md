# Freezer

*WIP*

The freezer contract will freeze received tokens and tell validators to release equivalent tokens on another chain.

Validation logic still isn't ready but the plan is to use PoS validator nodes which can subscribe to the events emitted by the contract and validate them.

Third Party trust is still required but we aim to minimize it as much as possible
