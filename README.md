# XP-HECO Migration

See web3-mint-contract for a wip multisig minter  

See validator for a wip web3 ChainListener

## Current status:
We can send transactions from a substrate chain to a web3 testnet!
Unfreezing token is broken right now

## TODO:

- run tests on heco's testnet
- Investigate why event catching with hardhat node isn't working (https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/1691)
